# Maintenance Page

This maintenance page was built using React and serves as a temporary placeholder while I work on developing my new and improved portfolio website.

### `What's Happening?`

I'm currently in the process of redesigning and rebuilding my personal portfolio site to better showcase my skills, projects, and experience. The new site will be launched soon, with enhanced features and a fresh design.

### `In the Meantime`

`Design Portfolio:` You can view my design work on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/hodandev).

`Development Projects:` Check out my coding projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/hodanmohamed/).

Thank you for your patience! Stay tuned for updates, and I look forward to sharing my new site with you soon.
